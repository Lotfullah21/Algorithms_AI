# Machine Learning Repository

Welcome to my machine learning repository! Below is a list of Jupyter notebooks that cover different topics in machine learning. These notebooks were created using Google Colaboratory and were last updated two years ago.

## 1. Gradient_Descent.ipynb
- Explore the concept of gradient descent, a fundamental optimization algorithm widely used in machine learning.

## 2. KNN.ipynb
- Learn about the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm, a simple yet effective method for classification and regression tasks.

## 3. Neuron.ipynb
- Introduction to the basic building block of neural networks: the neuron.

## 4. Perceptron.ipynb
- Delve into the perceptron algorithm, a foundational concept in neural networks and binary classification.

## 5. Weight_Initialization.ipynb
- Discuss the importance of weight initialization in neural networks and explore various methods.

## 6. grad.ipynb
- Cover topics related to gradients, possibly further exploring gradient-based optimization techniques.

## 7. network.ipynb
- Discuss the architecture and training of a neural network, providing insights into building and training a basic network.

## 8. updated_network.ipynb
- Possibly an updated version of the `network.ipynb` file, containing improvements or refinements to the network architecture or training process.

Feel free to explore these notebooks to gain a better understanding of various machine learning concepts. If you have any questions or suggestions, please don't hesitate to reach out!

**Note:** These notebooks were last updated two years ago, so while the concepts they cover are fundamental, there may have been advancements in the field since then.
